## Overview

To enhance analytical clarity and user engagement, the dashboard was developed in **Power BI** with a focus on **data visibility**, **interactivity**, and **interpretability**.  
Multiple visualization and control techniques were applied to ensure users can easily explore operational metrics, identify performance patterns, and derive insights at different levels of detail.

---

## 1. Consistent Visual Identity

The dashboard design follows **Ahamove’s corporate color scheme**, ensuring visual harmony and professional identity alignment.

- **Ahamove Orange (#F37021)** — used for highlights, alerts, and underperforming indicators.  
- **Ahamove Blue (#004C97)** — used for standard visuals and positive performance indicators.

This consistent application of brand colors enhances **visual recognition**, **user readability**, and maintains a unified BI experience.

---

## 2. Target-Based Color Indicators

Each key metric—particularly **Average Lead Time**, **Acceptance Rate (AR)**, and **Completion Rate (FR)**—is color-coded based on its performance relative to defined targets:

- Metrics meeting or exceeding target → displayed in **blue tones** (positive).  
- Metrics below target → displayed in **orange/red tones** (warning/critical).  

This approach allows users to **instantly identify performance gaps** without interpreting complex numerical tables.

---

## 3. Comparative Visualization

Comparative charts display **month-over-month variations** and **percentage changes** relative to KPI targets.  
This enables managers to easily detect **seasonal patterns**, such as the sharp **decline in AR during September and December**, and evaluate **recovery performance** in subsequent months.

---

## 4. Highlighting Risk Zones

A dedicated **scatter chart** identifies **operational risk zones**, where combinations of metrics (e.g., low FR and low AR) indicate inefficiencies.  
By emphasizing these zones, users can **visually pinpoint when and where performance deteriorates**, accelerating the **root cause identification** process.

---

## 5. Interactive Performance Tables

A series of **interactive performance tables** display the full list of operational entities (e.g., suppliers, districts, service types) with corresponding KPIs.  
To improve usability, **dynamic slicers** allow filtering by performance level:

- Top 5 / Top 10 performers  
- Bottom 5 / Bottom 10 performers  
- All records  

This interactivity supports **focused analysis** without overwhelming users with lengthy data lists.

---

## 6. Visualization Type Slicer (Order Layer)

A unique **visualization-type slicer** enables users to toggle between **Table View** and **Spaghetti Chart View** for the same dataset.

- **Table View:** For detailed numerical comparison and ranking.  
- **Spaghetti Chart View:** For time-based visualization of KPI fluctuations.  

This “**order layer**” flexibility allows users to adapt visualization style based on their analytical preference — supporting both precision analysis and trend exploration within a single dashboard.

---

## 7. Hierarchical Drill-Down

The dashboard incorporates a **hierarchical (Hitachi-style) drill-down** for deeper exploration of **time** and **customer dimensions**:

- Drill from **Month → Week → Day** to analyze specific operational periods.  
- Drill by **Customer Segment** (e.g., *Key Account vs. Retail*) to identify behavioral and performance differences.  

This **hierarchical navigation** design supports both **high-level monitoring** and **in-depth diagnostic analytics**, ensuring decision-makers can investigate performance drivers efficiently.

---

## Summary

The Power BI dashboard serves as the **visual analytics layer** of the Fabric Medallion Logistics Pipeline project, bridging data engineering outputs with actionable insights.  
Through a combination of brand-consistent design, color semantics, and interactive controls, it delivers a **clear, intuitive, and decision-oriented BI experience** for logistics performance monitoring.
